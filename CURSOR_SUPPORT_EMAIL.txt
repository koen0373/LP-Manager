Subject: Request for Pro Plan Extension (1 Month) - Critical AI Assistant Failure Cost $300 in Development Time

---

Dear Cursor Support Team,

I am writing to request compensation for a serious AI assistant failure that cost me $300 in billable development time and 20,000+ wasted tokens.

**My Account**:
- Subscription: Cursor Pro ($60/month)
- Professional rate: $200/hour
- Date of incident: October 24, 2025, 22:00-23:30 UTC

**Issue Summary**:
The AI assistant spent 90 minutes providing incorrect solutions due to a fundamental failure to ask basic discovery questions about my deployment setup. This resulted in:
- **$300 in lost billable time** (1.5 hours @ $200/hr)
- **20,000+ wasted tokens** (~33% of monthly Pro allocation)
- **Delayed critical deployment** (production bug fixes)

---

## What Happened

**The Problem**:
My Railway deployment wasn't picking up recent code changes. I asked the AI to help debug.

**The AI's Mistakes**:
1. **Assumed** I was using Nixpacks (Railway's default)
2. **Never asked** what build system I was using
3. **Never checked** my existing Dockerfile
4. Spent 90 minutes trying wrong solutions:
   - Created `railway.json` config (doesn't work with Docker)
   - Added Nixpacks-specific build commands
   - Made 5+ unnecessary git commits
   - Suggested multiple "force rebuild" triggers that had zero effect

**The Reality**:
- I have a **Dockerfile in my repo** (visible to AI from the start)
- Railway explicitly shows "Dockerfile - Automatically Detected" in settings
- The fix was a **2-line Dockerfile change**

**When It Was Fixed**:
After 90 minutes of failed attempts, I explicitly told the AI: *"Remember we're using Docker"*

Only THEN did it provide the correct solution:
```dockerfile
ARG CACHE_BUST=v0.1.2
RUN rm -rf .next
```

**This should have been the FIRST suggestion**, not the last.

## Root Cause Analysis

The AI failed basic professional consulting practices:

❌ **No discovery phase**: Didn't ask "Are you using Docker or Nixpacks?"  
❌ **No file inspection**: Didn't check for existing Dockerfile  
❌ **Assumption-based debugging**: Jumped to solutions without understanding the stack  
❌ **No validation**: Didn't verify why previous attempts failed  

As a $200/hour professional, I expect AI assistance to match basic consulting standards:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Inspect existing configuration
3. Provide targeted solutions

This incident represents a failure at the most fundamental level.

## Financial Impact

**Direct Costs**:
- Billable hours lost: 1.5 hours × $200/hr = **$300**
- Pro tokens wasted: 20,000 tokens = **33% of monthly allocation**
- Pro subscription value wasted: 33% × $60 = **$20**

**Indirect Costs**:
- Delayed production deployment (bug fixes pending)
- Git history pollution (5+ unnecessary commits)
- Mental overhead (debugging the debugger)
- Lost confidence in AI reliability

**Total measurable impact: ~$320**

## Requested Compensation

Given the severity and my Pro subscription level, I am requesting:

**Option A (Preferred)**: 
- **1 month free Pro subscription extension** ($60 value)
- Acknowledges the time + token waste
- Maintains my trust in Cursor as a professional tool

**Option B (Alternative)**:
- **50,000 token credit** (2.5× wasted tokens)
- Covers waste + compensates for my time debugging incorrect solutions

I believe Option A is fair given:
- My Pro subscription status ($60/month commitment)
- The severity of the error (fundamental discovery failure)
- The financial impact ($300 billable time)
- The precedent this sets for AI reliability

## Evidence

1. **Chat transcript**: Full conversation showing 90-minute wrong path
2. **Git log**: Multiple commits with "force rebuild" attempts
   - `1a81678`: "trigger: Force Railway redeploy"
   - `a30e74c`: "fix(build): Force clean build"
   - `31560df`: "FORCE RAILWAY REBUILD"
   - `be45d0b`: "fix(railway): Add railway.json config" (wrong approach)
   - `690b15e`: "fix(docker): Force clean Docker build" (correct fix)

3. **AI's acknowledgment**: *"Je hebt volkomen gelijk en mijn excuses voor deze blunder"*

4. **Railway settings screenshot**: Shows "Dockerfile - Automatically Detected" (available)

## Why This Matters

I chose Cursor Pro specifically because I bill at $200/hour and need reliable, professional-grade AI assistance. When the AI fails at basic discovery, it becomes a liability rather than an asset.

This incident cost me:
- 5× my monthly subscription in lost time
- 33% of my monthly token allocation
- Confidence in using AI for critical debugging

I trust Cursor will handle this appropriately and use it to improve discovery protocols in future AI interactions.

## Requested Action

Please provide:
1. **1 month Pro subscription extension** (preferred), OR
2. **50,000 token credit** (alternative)
3. Confirmation that this incident will inform AI training improvements

I'm a satisfied Pro customer and want to continue using Cursor, but need assurance that this type of fundamental error won't repeat.

Thank you for your understanding and prompt response.

Best regards,  
**Koen**

## 🏠 Homepage — Final order

1. **Hero (promise):** “The easy way to manage your liquidity pools.”  
2. **Problem:** LP chaos (too many dashboards, no overview).  
3. **Solution:** one clear dashboard (Enosys, BlazeSwap, SparkDEX).  
4. **Proof:** **Live demo pools** (glassy table, 75% container).  
5. **Subscription:** single **“Liquidity Journey”** block (Annual/Monthly toggle) with **“Start free trial”** under **every** plan; for **Tide**: secondary “Start free trial” next to “Join priority list”.  

> ❌ No waitlist / pre-launch content on the homepage (separate landing page later).

## 📊 Pool Table — UI spec (v2025.10)

- **Container width:** 75% centered (desktop), 92–94% (tablet/mobile).  
- **Glassy overlay:** `rgba(10,15,26,0.85–0.90)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(10–12px)`; water background must remain visible.  
- **Dividers:** `rgba(110,168,255,0.12)`; 8px vertical rhythm; **min-row-height: 140px**.  
- **Columns:** Specifics | Liquidity | Fees | Incentives | Range | Status.  
- **Specifics:** icons + pair + fee must **always stay on one line** (no wrap); min–max range **centered below**.  
- **Current Price slider:** thin baseline + single marker; **marker color must equal status color**.  
- **Status logic:**  
  - **In Range (green):** within `[min, max]` (earns fees).  
  - **Near Band (orange):** within **3%** of lower or upper bound (inside band).  
  - **Out of Range (red):** below min or above max.  
- **APY block:** add 12–16px spacing above label **“Average 24h APY”**; use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.

## ✒️ Typography & Style

- **Inter** for UI (tables, pricing, copy).  
- **Quicksand** for **logo/tagline/hero headings** only.  
- Buttons: aqua `#6EA8FF`, soft hover glow, **focus ring visible**.  
- Maintain transparency in key sections; **water background is part of the brand**.

---

## 🤝 AI Collaboration Rules

- Only **one AI** edits at a time — Claude ↔ GPT work **in series** (no parallel edits).  
- **Both** AIs must **document each change** in `/docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` (summary + changelog).  
- **Execution Check Rule:** GPT must ask before starting any new task:  
  “**Has the previous task been reviewed and confirmed as complete?**”

---

## ✅ Your first actions (do not skip)

1) **Execution check:** Ask if the previous task has been confirmed as complete.  
2) **Read `/docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`** end-to-end.  
3) **Gap analysis:** List any mismatches vs. this handover (pricing, homepage order, Pool Table specs, AI rules, transparency).  
4) **Propose the smallest next change** (3–5 bullets) to close the biggest gap with minimal risk.  
5) **On approval:** Apply **only that change**, test visually, and append a short **summary + changelog** to `/docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.

**Acceptance for the first change**
- Addresses one concrete gap (e.g., single pricing block merge; table container to 75%; slider marker=status color with 3% near-band).  
- Does **not** alter brand scope or tagline.  
- Follows glass aesthetic and typography rules.  
- Ends with a doc update and changelog in `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

# 🚂 Railway Build Error — Fix Guide

## 🔴 Problem

Railway deployment fails with:
```
Type error: Cannot find module '@/components/waitlist/WaitlistHero'
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

**Your local `main` branch is 11 commits ahead of `origin/main`.**

Railway builds from `origin/main` (the remote repository), which still has the OLD version of `pages/index.tsx` that imports waitlist components. Your local version is correct and updated.

## ✅ Solution

Push your local commits to GitHub:

```bash
cd /Users/koen/Desktop/Liquilab

# Verify you're on main branch
git branch

# Push all 11 commits to origin/main
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 Verification

After pushing:

1. **Check GitHub**: Visit your repository and confirm the latest commit appears
2. **Railway will auto-redeploy**: Railway watches `origin/main` and will automatically rebuild
3. **Monitor build logs**: Check Railway dashboard → Deployments tab

Expected result:
```
✓ Generated Prisma Client
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Creating an optimized production build
✓ Compiled successfully
```

## 📋 Alternative: Force Railway Rebuild

If push is delayed or you want to test immediately:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy" button (manual trigger)
5. Railway will pull latest `origin/main` and rebuild

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Never push to `origin/main` until local build succeeds**: Run `npm run build` first
- **Railway = Production**: Always test locally before pushing
- **11 commits pendingMenuThese include RangeBand™ V2, token icons, TokenIcon fallback fix, and incident resolutions

## 🧪 Pre-Push Checklist

Before `git push origin main`:

```bash
# 1. Clean build test
rm -rf .next
npm run build

# 2. Verify no TypeScript errors
# (build will fail if there are errors)

# 3. Check what will be pushed
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline

# 4. Push
git push origin main
```

**Issue:** Railway builds old code (origin/main) vs local updated code (main)  
**Fix:** `git push origin main` to sync

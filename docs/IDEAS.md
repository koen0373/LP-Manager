# LiquiLab Ideas Backlog (Single Source of Truth)

This backlog is the canonical list for product/tech/ops ideas. Keep it concise; decisions go into ADRs.

## Inbox
<!-- INBOX_START -->
<!-- INBOX_END -->

## Next (prioritized)
<!-- NEXT_START -->
<!-- NEXT_END -->

## Doing
<!-- DOING_START -->
<!-- DOING_END -->

## Done (reference only)
<!-- DONE_START -->
<!-- DONE_END -->

### How to use
- Capture ideas fast to **Inbox** (script adds timestamp + id).
- Weekly triage: promote items to **Next** (top 3–5), pull a few into **Doing**.
- When completed, move to **Done** (keep short).
- Decisions with impact → create an **ADR** (docs/ADRs).

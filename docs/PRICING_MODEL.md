# LiquiLab Pricing Model

LiquiLab has transitioned from per-pool billing to an annual subscription framework called the **Liquidity Journey**. Every plan includes a 14-day free trial with deferred payment capture.

## Early Access & Trial Onboarding
- Join the waitlist (or Fast-Track priority access) to activate the Liquidity Journey beta.
- Select a plan and authorize billing in USDT₀ (Flare Network); no funds are captured until the 14-day trial ends.
- Cancel anytime during the trial — the authorization is voided and no payment is processed.

## Liquidity Journey Plans

| Plan | Pool limit | Annual Price | Monthly Option | Description |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Shallow** | Up to 5 | $99.95/year | $9.95/mo | For new LPs exploring liquidity management |
| **Flow** | Up to 15 | $249.95/year | $24.95/mo | For active LPs managing multiple pools |
| **Depth** | Up to 50 | $749.95/year | $74.95/mo | For professionals and small teams |
| **Tide** | 50+ | Custom | Custom | For DAOs and organizations (enterprise access coming soon) |

### Billing Highlights
- Annual billing is the default; monthly is available for flexibility.
- Trial window: full platform access for 14 days at zero cost.
- Automatic capture occurs on day 14 if the subscription is still active.
- Customers can downgrade, upgrade, or switch billing cadence before capture.

## Invoicing & Receipts
- Crypto payments (USDT₀) trigger an automated CSV invoice compatible with GetGekko.
- Historical invoices remain accessible through the admin console and account emails.
- Enterprise/Tide customers coordinate bespoke invoicing and payment rails with the LiquiLab team.

## Supported DEXs
LiquiLab currently tracks pools from:
- **Enosys** – Uniswap v3-style NFT positions
- **BlazeSwap** – Uniswap v3-style NFT positions
- **SparkDEX** – Uniswap v2-style ERC-20 LP tokens

All venues follow the same subscription flow; pool limits are determined by the selected Liquidity Journey plan.

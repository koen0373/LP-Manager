# Brand Usage Rules

LiquiLab’s brand conveys clarity, confidence, and technical excellence. These guidelines apply to product surfaces, marketing materials, investor communications, and partner co-marketing.

## Core Identity

- **Primary logo:** LiquiLab droplet + wordmark. Use official SVGs from `/public/brand/`. Maintain clear space equal to the droplet width.
- **Tagline:** “The Liquidity Pool Intelligence Platform.” Always pair with the LiquiLab name.
- **Trademark line:** “LiquiLab® — Powered by RangeBand™.” Use in footers, splash screens, and investor decks.

## Typography

- Primary UI font: Inter (or approved substitute with similar metrics).
- Headline font: Quicksand (capitalised for hero lockups).
- Apply `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for financial metrics.

## Colour Palette

| Usage | Token | Hex |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Accent / CTA | Electric Blue | `#3B82F6` |
| Aura / Hover | Light Electric | `#60A5FA` |
| Highlight / Signals | Aqua | `#1BE8D2` (checkmarks only) |
| Neutral text | Mist | `#9CA3AF` |
| Background | Midnight | `#0A0F1C` |

Do not introduce unapproved colours without design sign-off.

## RangeBand™ Attribution

- Any UI element, chart, or document showcasing RangeBand™ must include the legend “RangeBand™ — patent pending”.
- When RangeBand™ data powers an external integration, add the credit line “Powered by RangeBand™”.

## Asset Handling

- Store master assets under Git LFS (`brandguide/`, `/public/media/`) to preserve fidelity and timestamps.
- Do not export flattened raster logos for production use; prefer vector assets.

## Partner & Third-Party Mentions

- Mention partner platforms (Enosys, SparkDEX, BlazeSwap) as text only unless a written agreement authorises logo usage.
- Include a third-party acknowledgment statement when external marks appear: “All third-party trademarks are the property of their respective owners.”

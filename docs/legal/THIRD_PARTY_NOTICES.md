# Third-Party Notices

This document lists open-source software, fonts, icons, and other third-party materials incorporated into the LiquiLab platform. Maintain it as the single source of truth for compliance and attribution.

## How to Update

1. Generate dependency reports as part of each release cycle:
   ```sh
   npm ls --all > build/reports/npm-deps.txt
   npm run licenses:json # if configured
   ```
2. Summarise key libraries with their license identifiers, URLs, and attribution requirements.
3. Include non-code assets (fonts, icons, illustrations) and cite authors/licenses.

## Current Status

> _Placeholder_: Populate this section with the next dependency audit.

| Component | Version | License | Source | Notes |

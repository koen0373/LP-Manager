# Trademark Guidance

LiquiLab maintains a strict trademark policy to protect the integrity of its brands and products. This document summarises approved usage.

## Core Marks

| Mark | Status | Correct Usage | Notes |
|------|--------|---------------|-------|
| **LiquiLab®** | Registered (or registration pending in core jurisdictions) | Always capitalise the “L” and include the ® symbol on first use in each asset. | Acceptable shortened form “LiquiLab” after first reference. |
| **RangeBand™** | Trademark (application pending) | Include the ™ symbol on every primary visual and textual reference. | Tagline “RangeBand™ — patent pending” preferred in legal notices. |

## General Rules

1. Use the marks as adjectives (e.g., “LiquiLab® platform”, “RangeBand™ visualization”) and never as nouns or verbs.
2. Do not alter, abbreviate, or translate the marks. Avoid plurals or possessive forms unless explicitly approved.
3. Always pair the mark with the LiquiLab corporate name on first mention: “LiquiLab® RangeBand™ visualization”.
4. Include the trademark attribution line in materials that reference the marks:  
   `LiquiLab and RangeBand are trademarks or registered trademarks of LiquiLab B.V.`

## Third-Party Marks

- Partner ecosystems currently referenced: **Enosys**, **SparkDEX**, **BlazeSwap**. Use their standard casing and append ™/® only when officially confirmed.
- Never embed third-party logos, icons, or wordmarks without written approval. Text references only.
- Maintain clear context that third-party marks belong to their respective owners.

## Unauthorised Uses

- No co-branding, lockups, or merged marks with external brands without legal approval.
- Do not imply endorsement, partnership, or certification unless a governing agreement is in place.
- Avoid using LiquiLab or RangeBand in domain names, social media handles, advertising keywords, or product names without prior consent.

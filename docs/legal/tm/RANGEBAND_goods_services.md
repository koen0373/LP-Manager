## Technical Description (for USPTO/EUIPO understanding)

RangeBand™ refers to a proprietary system for visualizing and classifying cryptocurrency liquidity pool positions based on their price range characteristics:

- **Visualization Component:** Horizontal band display showing min/max price boundaries with current price marker
- **Strategy Classification:** Algorithm that categorizes pools as Aggressive (<12% range width), Balanced (12-35%), or Conservative (>35%)
- **Status Indicators:** Real-time display of whether current price is "In Range," "Near Band," or "Out of Range"
- **Calculation Method:** Range width percentage = ((max - min) / midpoint) × 100

## Drafting Notes for Counsel

- **Specificity:** The specification describes the unique visualization and analytical methodology that distinguishes RangeBand from generic charting tools
- **Protectable Elements:** The combination of visual design, strategy classification methodology, and status indicators creates a distinctive system worthy of trademark protection
- **Scope:** Classes 42 and 9 cover both the SaaS delivery and potential future downloadable versions
- **Class 36:** Included to protect the analytical methodology as a financial information service
- **Secondary Meaning:** While "range" and "band" are common words, their combination in this specific context for cryptocurrency liquidity pool analysis is distinctive
- **Use Requirement:** Mark is consistently used with ™ symbol in the UI and promotional materials

**Recommended Strategy:**  
File in Class 42 first (primary software service), then Classes 9 and 36. The technical novelty and distinctive visual presentation support strong trademark protection for "RangeBand" in the fintech/crypto software space.

**Possible Objections & Responses:**  
- If examiner finds "Band" descriptive of graphical displays, argue that the complete mark "RangeBand" as applied to cryptocurrency liquidity pool strategy classification is distinctive and has acquired secondary meaning through specific use
- Prepare evidence of: (1) market recognition, (2) unique visual design elements, (3) proprietary calculation methodology
